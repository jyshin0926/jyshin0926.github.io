During my internship at TmaxSoft as a data engineer, I noticed that many colleagues were stressed by the arduous preprocessing of speech-text pair data. This process involved various tricky elements, such as floating-point numbers, positive and negative values, dates, Korean and English words, alphabets, and mathematical and chemical symbols. \\
To address this, I created a [preprocessing tool](https://github.com/jyshin0926/TxtTransTool/blob/master/TxtTransTool.exe) after work hours that processed individual words or sentences according to Korean pronunciation rules with a single mouse click. I developed this tool in just two days and deployed it within the company, doubling task efficiency and significantly improving my colleaguesâ€™ work-life balance.

For a more detailed explanation and the corresponding code, please refer to the [Executable File](https://github.com/jyshin0926/TxtTransTool/blob/master/README_eng.md) and [Source Code](https://github.com/jyshin0926/TxtTransTool_code/blob/master/README_eng.md).
