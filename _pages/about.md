# About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m **Jaeyoung Shin**, an **AI Research Engineer** specializing in **expressive speech synthesis, multilingual TTS, and multimodal generative models**.  
I currently work as a **freelancer at [ScaleAI](https://scale.com/)**, optimizing generative models and ensuring the safety and quality of AI-generated responses.  
Previously, I contributed to **voice cloning, expressive TTS, and audio quality assessment** at **[GenesisLab](https://home.genesislab.ai/)** and **[PuzzleAI](https://puzzle-ai.com/)**.

## What I Do
My research focuses on making **speech AI more expressive, natural, and robust**. Key areas of expertise include:
- **Expressive Speech Synthesis** â€“ Enhancing **emotional and prosodic** quality in AI-generated speech.
- **Multimodal AI** â€“ Integrating **text, speech, and vision** to improve generative models.
- **Speech Enhancement & Retrieval** â€“ Improving **audio quality and assessment** using deep learning.

## Research & Experience
Originally trained in **marine biology**, I transitioned into **AI research** after discovering the potential of deep learning in **cognitive neuroscience and speech technology**.  

- **AI Scientist at [GenesisLab](https://home.genesislab.ai/)** â€“ Developed **voice cloning, expressive TTS, and chatbot programs** using LLMs.
- **AI Researcher at [PuzzleAI](https://puzzle-ai.com/)** â€“ Focused on **speaker verification, real-time noise reduction, and document summarization**.
- **Undergraduate Intern at [Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Laboratory](https://cocoanlab.github.io/), [IBS](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng.do/)** â€“ Applied **fMRI analysis, deep learning, and signal processing** to study brain responses.
- **Intern at [TmaxSoft](https://www.tmaxsoft.com/en/introduction/overview)** â€“ Created a **[Python tool](https://github.com/jyshin0926/TxtTransTool/blob/master/README_eng.md)** that **doubled** text preprocessing efficiency.

## Current Focus
Iâ€™m currently working on **IMPACT-TTS**, a multimodal emotional TTS system designed to overcome **low-resource constraints** (submitted to ACL 2025).  
Additionally, I contribute to **AI safety research**, ensuring generative models remain **trustworthy and ethical**.

## Contact
I welcome opportunities to discuss my research and collaborations in speech AI and deep learning.

<!-- Hello, Iâ€™m Jaeyoung Shin, an AI Research Engineer and currently working for [ScaleAI](https://scale.com/) as a freelancer.

Today, I specialize in auditing generative models' quality and development. 
Additionally, I have been researching the speech processing field, especially for speech synthesis and enhancement while working for [GenesisLab](https://home.genesislab.ai/) and [PuzzleAI](https://puzzle-ai.com/). 
My work spans projects in voice cloning, expressive TTS, audio quality assessment, and audio retrieval.

My interest has always been anchored in the beneficial potential of science and technology for society. 
Reflecting on the essentials for enhancing life quality, I sought to understand people's needs and the solutions to address their challenges and elevate their happiness. 

Therefore, in my sophomore year as a biology major, I joined a university club addressing social issues and led a project linking depression to brain activity, using insights from my biology studies to provide personalized feedback to students.

Captivated by the intersection of psychology and neurology, I researched at [Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Laboratory](https://cocoanlab.github.io/), [IBS](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng.do) as an undergraduate intern. 
Here, I utilized functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to observe brain responses to stimuli, interpreting the data with deep learning and signal processing techniques. 

Even after starting computer science, I kept my goal to use my knowledge and techniques to improve people's lives. 
During internship at [TmaxSoft](https://www.tmaxsoft.com/en/introduction/overview), I created a [Python tool](https://github.com/jyshin0926/TxtTransTool/blob/master/README_eng.md) after work hours, which simplified the arduous task of text data preprocessing within two days for colleagues, ultimately doubling overall task efficiency.

As an AI scientist engaged in the generative AI field, my current focus is on developing reliable discrimination techniques to identify authentic versus synthetic media.
