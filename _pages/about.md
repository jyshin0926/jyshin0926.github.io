<!-- Jaeyoung Shin's Personal Website -->
Hello, Iâ€™m Jaeyoung Shin, an AI Research Engineer based in Seoul, South Korea. 
Today, I specialize in expressive speech synthesis, multilingual NLP, and self-supervised learning. My work spans projects in voice cloning, emotional speech synthesis, audio quality assessment, and audio retrieval.

My interest has always been anchored in the beneficial potential of science and technology for society. Reflecting on the essentials for enhancing life quality, I sought to understand people's needs and the solutions to address their challenges and elevate their happiness. This curiosity was first sparked during my study of bioscience, where I applied data-driven methods to analyze marine life and neurological responses, later transitioning into computer science to broaden my impact.

In my sophomore year, I joined a university association club, dedicating two years to addressing social issues. We discovered that mental illness, particularly depression, was a prevalent issue. My contributions were informed by observing neurological responses during a biotechnology experiment, which suggested a correlation with human mental health. This insight led us to collectively study neuroscience, with my guidance.

Subsequently, I led a project linking depression to brain activity, giving university students personalized feedback based on our findings. This approach was well-received, with students finding it compelling enough to seek medical advice.

Captivated by the intersection of psychology and neurology, I interned at Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Laboratory. Here, I utilized functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to observe brain responses to stimuli, interpreting the data with deep learning techniques. This experience reinforced my belief in the broad applicability of computer science and steered my academic focus toward it.

Even after starting computer science, I kept my goal to use my knowledge and techniques to improve people's lives. At 'TmaxSoft', I created a Python tool that simplified the arduous task of text data preprocessing, aligning text with corresponding audio per pronunciation rules. This simple but efficient tool, which I developed in two days and shared with my colleagues, significantly increased efficiency, doubling task performance and earning their gratitude.

As an AI scientist engaged in the generative AI field, my current focus is on developing reliable discrimination techniques to identify authentic versus synthetic media.
