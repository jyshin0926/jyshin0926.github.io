I received an Excellence Prize in BigData Campus Contest (2020) for developing a location recommendation algorithm for the policy for estabilishing childcare centers based on data analysis, using various machine learning and NLP techniques such as TF-IDF and KNN.
 
The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jyshin0926/BigDataCampusContest) and our presentation can also be viewed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-jYxLmNBp0).
