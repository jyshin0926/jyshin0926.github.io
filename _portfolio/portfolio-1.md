At GenesisLab, I led and worked on developing AI Interviewer and AI doctor as part of the company's services.
* AI Interviewer TTS samples: You can listen to the text-to-speech samples for the AI Interviewer on [this page](https://jealous-father-6b2.notion.site/TTS-Experiment-Results-for-AI-Interviewer-231230-1585e6c5fc6980a287dcf912b3b1d8c7?pvs=7).
* AI doctor TTS Samples: The text-to-speech samples for the AI Doctor TTS are available on [this page](https://jealous-father-6b2.notion.site/TTS-Results-for-AI-Doctor-24-01-1655e6c5fc698036a13af0a0c7d83f33).

Previously, I awarded 2nd Prize in the Youth Talent Practical Project Contest (November 11, 2020) for developing a speech synthesis service within a week utilizing lightweight Griffin-Lim algorithm. The service integrated features of Tacotron and Tacotron2, specifically designed for generating meme content.
The code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jyshin0926/KoreanTTS).

I am currently researching controllable emotional TTS with multi-modal prompts and have independently authored a paper that is under review for NAACL 2025.
