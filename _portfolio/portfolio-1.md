🎤 **Description:**  
This AI Interviewer, developed at **GenesisLab**, leverages **speech recognition and AI-driven dialogue generation** to simulate real-time job interviews. It can analyze **candidate responses, tone, and language fluency** to provide structured feedback.

📌 **My Role:**  
At GenesisLab, I led and worked on developing AI Interviewer and AI doctor as part of the company's services.
- Developed **voice synthesis and response generation** models.
- Worked on **speech enhancement, audio quality assessment and emotion analysis**.
- Optimized **speech recognition accuracy** for natural dialogue flow.

## AI Doctor TTS Samples
🔬 **AI Doctor** utilizes **text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis** to enhance AI-powered medical consultations by generating clear and expressive speech responses.

## Speech Synthesis Research & Achievements
- 🏆 **2nd Prize - Youth Talent Practical Project Contest (Nov 11, 2020)**  
  Developed a **speech synthesis service** within a week using a lightweight **Griffin-Lim algorithm**. The system combined features of **Tacotron and Tacotron2** for generating meme content.  
  🔗 **Code available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jyshin0926/KoreanTTS).**

- 📄 **Research in Controllable Emotional TTS**  
  Currently investigating **multi-modal prompts for expressive and controllable speech synthesis**. Independently authored a **research paper**, which is **under review for ACL 2025**.

Previously, I awarded 2nd Prize in the Youth Talent Practical Project Contest (November 11, 2020) for developing a speech synthesis service within a week utilizing lightweight Griffin-Lim algorithm. The service integrated features of Tacotron and Tacotron2, specifically designed for generating meme content.
The code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jyshin0926/KoreanTTS).

I am currently researching controllable emotional TTS with multi-modal prompts and have independently authored a paper that is under review for ACL 2025. -->
