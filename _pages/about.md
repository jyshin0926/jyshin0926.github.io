This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! -->

<!-- Jaeyoung Shin's Personal Website -->
Hello, I’m Jaeyoung Shin, an AI researcher and developer based in Seoul, South Korea. My passion for innovation stems from an early fascination with how science and technology can address societal challenges. This curiosity was first sparked during my study of bioscience, where I applied data-driven methods to analyze marine life and neurological responses, later transitioning into computer science to broaden my impact.

Today, I specialize in expressive speech synthesis, multilingual NLP, and self-supervised learning. My work spans projects in voice cloning, emotional speech synthesis, audio quality assessment, and audio retrieval. contributing to advancements in human-centered AI. Collaborating with multiple organizations, I strive to turn complex challenges into transformative applications that enhance daily life.

This blog is a space to share insights, research, and ideas at the intersection of AI and human impact. Whether you’re exploring the latest breakthroughs, seeking inspiration, or interested in collaboration, I’m excited to connect and exchange knowledge.
