<!-- Jaeyoung Shin's Personal Website -->
Hello, Iâ€™m Jaeyoung Shin, an AI Research Engineer and currently working for [ScaleAI](https://scale.com/) as a freelancer.

Today, I specialize in auditing generative models' quality and development. 
Additionally, I have been researching the speech processing field, especially for speech synthesis and enhancement while working for [GenesisLab](https://home.genesislab.ai/) and [PuzzleAI](https://puzzle-ai.com/). 
My work spans projects in voice cloning, expressive TTS, audio quality assessment, and audio retrieval.

My interest has always been anchored in the beneficial potential of science and technology for society. 
Reflecting on the essentials for enhancing life quality, I sought to understand people's needs and the solutions to address their challenges and elevate their happiness. 

In my sophomore year, I joined a university association club and spent two years addressing social issues, with a focus on mental illness and depression.
Since I was majoring in biology for my Bachelor's degree, my contributions were informed by observing neurological responses during a biology experiment, which suggested a correlation with human mental health. 
Subsequently, I led a project linking depression to brain activity, giving university students personalized feedback based on our findings. 

Captivated by the intersection of psychology and neurology, I researched at [Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Laboratory](https://cocoanlab.github.io/), [IBS](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng.do) as an undergraduate intern. 
Here, I utilized functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to observe brain responses to stimuli, interpreting the data with deep learning techniques. 
This experience reinforced my belief in the broad applicability of signal processing and computer science and steered my academic focus toward it.

Even after starting computer science, I kept my goal to use my knowledge and techniques to improve people's lives. 
At [TmaxSoft](https://www.tmaxsoft.com/en/introduction/overview), I created a [Python tool](https://github.com/jyshin0926/TxtTransTool/blob/master/README_eng.md) that simplified the arduous task of text data preprocessing within two days for colleagues, and this doubled the task efficiency overall.

As an AI scientist engaged in the generative AI field, my current focus is on developing reliable discrimination techniques to identify authentic versus synthetic media.
